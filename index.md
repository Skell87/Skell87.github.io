# Struggle, Failure and Increase.
---

### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
   <p> Starting a new journey is both simple and difficult, like Bilbo Baggins says:
    </p>

> “It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.”

<p> No truer story has ever been told. Starting this week was easy. Take a step, learn something new, take another step, repeat.
    the struggle isnt in the walking, its in the resolve to overcome hills, valleys, mountains and rivers. Bumping up against obstacles of knowledge such as not knowing Git or GitHub, how to use markdown effectively or just displaying the right page. these things can only be overcome with resolve and the quest for knowledge with an undying perseverence, The bonus is that the next hill just may look a little smaller.</p>

### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
   <p> I am most excited to start using Javascript and Python, Im also excited to create working programs. Today I was introduced to some small cyber security concepts as well and eventually want to look into that direction, AI as well seems to be an amazing subject. </p>

### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
   <p> Full disclosure, Im an insecure person on the inside, I have to choose minute by minute to not give up on my path. I have immense vision but lack tools. My passion is to preach the Gospel and to help people in need, no matter what they belive or who they are, I honestly love people. My hope is that by learning the tools of tech, i can merge these passions and visions together to create something that has impact on even one person's life for the better. </p>

## What is something I wish i had the coding skills to accomplish?
   <p> I am very satisfied with what I'm learning and the pace at which I'm going. that being said, I most wish that i was just better and more experienced at what im learning. Today i finished a webpage using HTML and CSS, but the webpage 
         wasnt necesarily something that i would call a finished product or even beautiful in its own way. It was effective, but brutish and spartan at best. Nevertheless, the act of doing it was a victory in gaining knowledge and experience. I'll get better, I'll keep succeeding and i'll keep growing. </p>

## What am I struggling with?
   <p>I am mostly struggling with the raw amount of new and unknown data that i have to ingest and use on a weekly basis. This week alone has been like battling a hydra, I learn one lesson, element or new operation, and two or three more pieces of knowledge present themselves. The learning process itself is a challenge. Luckily I have resources in my peers, Instructors and google. Again the main lesson is to take in what I can and keep moving. Allow the process to have its way and not to give up.</p>

## What methods do i use to get unstuck?
   <p> When Im stuck, I look at the clock and note the time. I try to look over my code or google my problem to see if there are errors or get inspiration. If i find a useful solution I'll try it and see if it works. I iterate a couple of times and if I still havent succeeded, then I take a break, come back and ask an instructor. The key is to take it slow, be thorough and code efficiently. efficiency doesnt mean fast, it means methodical. Ive found that i can eliminate most issues i have if I am able to slow down and make sure its right the first time. An added benefit to going slow is that if you run into an issue, its probably a real issue, not a silly mistake... most of the time.</p>

## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?
   <P>So far in my learning journey and experience, I can say that HTML, CSS, and JS really seem to be powerful tools compared to more streamlined web content programs. To me the comparison is, as having an entire workshop filled with every woodworking tool and resource you would ever need compared to having an Ikea kit. Although that may be a too simple comparison. By learning these 3 languages, not only does it provide a platform of experience for learning other languages, but they allow us to have the power to make anything and if necessary, make the tools to make anything.</P>

## What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
   <p> My blog at this writing is pretty spartan. I have an image on the first post, that is considered an object. Its some element in my page that encapsulates data and behavior.</p>

# Awesome Inc. Bootcamp Week 4.

## What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
   <p>The most helpful thing during our remote weeks was having consistent access to our instructor to ask for help. our instructors are so patient to help us with redundand or seemingly silly questions, but coding is hard, it always will be until we readily learn how to solve problems critically and think like programmers.</p>

## What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
   <p>The bigget challenge that ive faced during onboarding has been to really understand the concepts were supposed to be learning. we have a ton of resources at our disposal in the form of videos and documents, however, i feel like learning these concepts requires a more guided hand. I can honestly say that ive learned alot in the last 4 weeks, but im concerned if ive learned the right things or if ive reached the accurate level of understanding. I have had to watch tutorials for projects and learn to reverse engineer, conceptualize and re-implement what ive learned to create projects. I have an understanding of how the projects work and why but I wonder if I started from scratch, if I could re-create them. now, of my own volition and initiative, Im taking the time to identify weak areas and learn.</p>

## How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
   <p>Asking for help can not be understated, ALWAYS ASK, even if it's annoying. Again, this is hard, you dont know what you dont know and that statement has rung true several times this week. i think the key is also learning how to process what kind of help you get. for example: if you ask someone for help, repeat back what they say, take notes, find a way to internalize their advice. If you find a tutorial to help, dont copy the code, listen for a concept you dont know the pause the video, study it, attempt to write code after understanding it, if you dont hit a breakthrough, go back to the video and repeat the process until you can write the code, explain the code in a way someone will understand. that way despite being "given the answer" you also took a lesson.</p>

# Awesome Inc. Bootcamp Week 5.

## What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
   <p>The number one thing that held me back this week was not making the connection between what we learned about state, and using objects in Javascript. Objects are a great way to store data and our assignment to manipulate the state of a webpage could be the perfect use case for it. My goal going forward is to assess any project I start by thinking about what tools I've learned that may be useful, even prior to pseudocoding.</p>

## What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
   <p>I am very interested in learning enough overall Javascript to be able to “see” a path through a project prior to coding. Knowing what tools I have in my kit and how to apply them will be a fundamental force multiplier for my success in using that and other languages. I feel like I'm getting the hang of Javascript, but as we progress I know that I'll only just refine and learn more.</p>

## What is your “Why”?
<p>My “why” in doing this boot camp is simple, I want to change the world for the better in some way. Specifically, my wife and I want to work as a full time missionary in other countries. How are these two things related? Tech is the perfect job to get me into other countries and keep us supported remotely while we bring the gospel. I also think that the ability to make whatever I want in a digital space is pretty rad.</p>


# Awesome inc. Bootcamp Week 5.

## What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?
<p>The big thing ive tried to focus on in the development process is to decentralize your javascript resources. instead of making one big giant block of code that cant easily be changes, break it into pieces and write the blocks to be small and easy to plug in and take out, then make code to tie it all together.</p>

## What does it mean to develop good code?
<p>Good code should be easily labeled and read, concise and understandable. I think its more about making it easily understood than necesarily being ultra efficient. if someone who needs to read your code cant, despite being super efficient, then no one wins. but if your code works, is easy to understand and is easily changed or added to, thats the sweet spot.</p>

## What does it mean to be a good developer?
<p>At this point i believe a good developer has the obvious traits of hard working and teachable, but a developer who can solve problems, think critically and knows to ask for help can and will go farther.</p>

## What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
<p>programmers hate re-writing the same code! at least they should. learning to automate and make one tool to do many things is key to good organization and efficiency.</p>
