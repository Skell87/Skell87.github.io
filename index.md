# Struggle, Failure and Increase.
---

### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
   <p> Starting a new journey is both simple and difficult, like Bilbo Baggins says:
    </p>

<p> No truer story has ever been told. Starting this week was easy. Take a step, learn something new, take another step, repeat.
    the struggle isnt in the walking, its in the resolve to overcome hills, valleys, mountains and rivers. Bumping up against obstacles of knowledge such as not knowing Git or GitHub, how to use markdown effectively or just displaying the right page. these things can only be overcome with resolve and the quest for knowledge with an undying perseverence, The bonus is that the next hill just may look a little smaller.</p>

### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
   <p> I am most excited to start using Javascript and Python, Im also excited to create working programs. Today I was introduced to some small cyber security concepts as well and eventually want to look into that direction, AI as well seems to be an amazing subject. </p>

### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
   <p> Full disclosure, Im an insecure person on the inside, I have to choose minute by minute to not give up on my path. I have immense vision but lack tools. My passion is to preach the Gospel and to help people in need, no matter what they belive or who they are, I honestly love people. My hope is that by learning the tools of tech, i can merge these passions and visions together to create something that has impact on even one person's life for the better. </p>
